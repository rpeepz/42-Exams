--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes an undefined number of arguments and writes on
standard output an integer representation of those options, stored as bit flags,
followed by a newline.

An option is an argument that begins by a '-' and has multiple characters which
could be: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

All options are stocked in a single int and each option represents a bit of that
int, and should be stocked like this:

00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

Launching the program without arguments, or with the '-h' flag, must print a
usage on the standard output, as shown in the following examples.

A wrong option must print "Invalid Option" followed by a newline.

Examples:
$>./options
options: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$>./options -abc -ijk
1799
$>./options -z | cat -e
33554432$
$>./options -abc -hijk
options: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$>./options -%
Invalid Option
