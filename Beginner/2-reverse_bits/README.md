# Reverse Bits

Write a function that takes a byte, reverses it, bit by bit (like the example) and returns the result.

Your function must be declared as follows:
``` c
unsigned char	reverse_bits(unsigned char octet);
```
Example:
``` c
  1 byte
_____________
 0100  0001
     ||
     \/
 1000  0010
 ```
