## 42 Exams

The question here are to serve as a basic test to your understanding of the C language. The logical requirement to solve these questions are quite high for someone who has studdied programming for less than one year (more so for the higher levels). It is also helpful to have some understanding of how instuctions are carried out in the program (such as string manipulation). Some solutions for these beginner questions are offered in the [piscine] during their exams and some of the higher level questions are even seen during their final.
