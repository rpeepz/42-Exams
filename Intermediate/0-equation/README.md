# Equation

The goal of this exercise is to find all possible answers to the following
equation :
```
	AB + CA = n
```
where A, B, and C are individual digits [0-9] and n is an integer.

>Note that here AB is not the product of A and B. It is merely a two digit number
with A being the first digit (tens place) and B the second digit (ones place).

The function must be declared as follows:

``` c
void    equation(int n);
```

<br>

Example :
``` c
For the value n = 42, the output would be :

$> ./equation 42
A = 0, B = 2, C = 4
A = 1, B = 1, C = 3
A = 2, B = 0, C = 2
A = 3, B = 9, C = 0
$>
