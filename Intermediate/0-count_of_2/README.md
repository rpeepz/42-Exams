# Equation

>Implement a function which counts, for a given integer n, the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).


The function must be declared as follows:

``` c
int    count_of_2(int n);
```

>- If n <= 1, the function returns 0;

<br>

Example :
``` c
input  = 25
output =  9

because there are 9 2s in (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25)
```
