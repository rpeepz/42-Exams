# Intermediate
## 42 Exams

The question here are much harder than the [Beginner] series, and have a higher logical requirement (more so for the higher levels), as well as a deeper understanding of how instuctions are carried out in the program. Some solutions for these intermediate questions are expected to pass an efficiency filter, that is to create logic that will process in as little as order(n) time.
