# 42 Exams  

Here you will find exam questions from my time at 42, and the solutions that I came up with during the stressful time I spent alone in the dark.

This repository is split into two parts: [Beginner] and [Intermediate].

These many problems have many solutions, there is no single _right_ answer but there are many incorrect soultions (as you might see from my results), as the test here is to find your own ability with no resources; armed only with your mind and a terminal. It also serves the major test: the ability to follow directions.
